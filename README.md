# The Percentage Cube

*Last updated: April 7, 2018*

This repository contains all the code I wrote during my Ph.D. study at the University of Houston for the "Percentage Cube" project.

A percentage cube is a generalized data cube that takes percentages as its basic measure. More precisely, a percentage cube shows the fractional relationship in every cuboid between each aggregated measure on several dimensions and its rolled-up measure aggregated by fewer dimensions.
