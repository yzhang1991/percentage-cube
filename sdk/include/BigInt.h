/***
 * Brief: Contains code for integer (or fixed point) code.
 *
 * Description: This is for performing extended precision integer arithmetic.
 *   The chosen internal representation is pure binary (64-bit full words)
 *   Other nuances are inherited from Vertica integers (such as the NULL rep)
 *   The format is 2's complement to make best use of the system math
 *
 * Notes:  This is a purely little-endian scheme; big-endian could be defined
 *  as well.
 *
 * TODOs: This can still be optimized significantly, by making better use of
 *   64-bit instructions and so on.  It is just a first cut at the API.
 *
 * Creation Date: 1-Jul-2008
